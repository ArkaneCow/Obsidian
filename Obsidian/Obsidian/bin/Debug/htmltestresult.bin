An amazingly adaptable programming language, pronounced C <strong class="highlight">sharp</strong>, that is part of the .NET Framework from Microsoft, which also includes VB.NET, Managed C++, and J# among some other open source projects and ASP.NET but it's not really a language as much as a Markup Language IMHO. <br/><br/>C# is much like C++ in syntax, but it is simpler to write object oriented code with it as the .NET Framework provides built in code libraries you can use across all the Framework languages, like TextWriter to write a text file. No need to manually write mountains of code to write a text file like some languages.<br/><br/>It has a Garbage Collector or GC, which differs it from C++ greatly. The GC cleans up memory so you don't have to manage it, nice eh? Stops most memory leaks (you online gamers know of them, as almost every game is written in C++ and those CTDs are usually memory leaks) so as long as you ain't a code tool you should be safe with the GC releasing the objects from memory.<br/><br/>There is also the GAC, or Global Assembly Cache. It is the residence of the .NET Framework and anything you want to add like a custom library or assembly, basically a collection of commonly used code, making it accessible to any .NET application on that machine or web server if running ASP.NET. <br/><br/>
